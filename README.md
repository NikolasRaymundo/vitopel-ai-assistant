# üß† Vitopel AI Assistant

An AI-powered assistant for industrial operations, designed to provide fast, accurate answers to maintenance and production questions ‚Äî using only trusted internal documentation.

This is a real-world project I'm leading at **Vitopel**, a BOPP film manufacturer, where operators and technicians often struggle to find key information in thousands of scattered documents.

## üöß Problem We're Solving

Vitopel‚Äôs plant runs complex machinery (e.g. Bruckner lines, slitters, chillers). Over time, we‚Äôve accumulated thousands of documents:
- Maintenance manuals
- Quality control logs
- SOPs
- Excel reports
- Scanned troubleshooting forms

When a line breaks at 3am, operators don‚Äôt have time to dig through this. That‚Äôs where this assistant comes in.

## üß© How It Works

The assistant:
- Ingests technical documents of any type (PDF, Excel, Word, scanned images)
- Extracts clean, searchable text (including OCR)
- Classifies and chunks content using GPT-4
- Stores it in a semantic vector database
- Lets users ask questions in natural language (English or Portuguese)
- Responds with **only** answers explicitly found in the documents, with:
  - Page numbers
  - Document name
  - Confidence level
  - Visual fallback notices if diagrams are needed

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

| Component      | Tools / Libraries                      |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Ingestion**  | `pymupdf`, `pytesseract`, `python-docx`, `pandas` |
| **Classification** | `openai` GPT-4 API                    |
| **Vector Search**  | `llama-index` + `chromadb`            |
| **Backend**    | `FastAPI`                               |
| **Frontend**   | `Streamlit` (MVP), planned React + PDF.js |
| **OCR**        | `Tesseract`                             |
